<h2>Project Name: Event Planner PWA (Meet_App)</h2>
<h3>Objective: </h3>
Develop a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) approach, integrating the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.
<br>

<h3>Context: </h3>
Serverless architecture and PWAs have gained significant traction in recent years. By integrating these two concepts, this application will benefit from:
<br>

<ul>
  <li>Serverless: No backend maintenance, scalability, constant availability, and no costs for idle time.</li>
  <li>PWAs: Instant loading, offline support, push notifications, “add to home screen” prompt, responsive design, and cross-platform compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<br>
The app will employ TDD, writing tests before the actual functionality. This approach ensures a focus on requirements and promotes high-quality code through immediate feedback. 
Additionally, the app will include data visualization to enhance user experience and facilitate data interpretation.

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Filter Events by City: Users can search for events in a specific city.</li>
  <liShow/Hide Event Details: Toggle event details for a cleaner interface.></li>
  <li>Specify Number of Events: Users can customize the number of events displayed.</li>
  <li>Offline Usage: The app remains functional without an internet connection.</li>
  <li>Add to Home Screen: Users can add a shortcut to their home screen.</li>
  <li>Event Details Charts: Visual representations of event data through charts.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Framework: Built using React.</li>
  <li>Development Technique: Test-driven development (TDD).</li>
  <li>API Integration: Utilizes Google Calendar API and OAuth2 authentication.</li>
  <li>Serverless Functions: Uses AWS Lambda for authorization.</li>
  <li>Version Control: Hosted on GitHub.</li>
  <li>Browser Compatibility: Supports the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera, as well as IE11.</li>
  <li>Responsive Design: Displays well on all screen sizes, including mobile and tablet (1920px to 320px widths).</li>
  <li>PWA Compliance: Passes Lighthouse’s PWA checklist.</li>
  <li>Offline Support: Functions offline or in slow network conditions with a service worker.</li>
  <li>Installable: Users can install the app on desktop and add it to their home screen on mobile.</li>
  <li>Deployment: Deployed on GitHub Pages.</li>
  <li>Alert System: Implements an OOP-based alert system.</li>
  <li>Data Visualization: Includes visual data representations.</li>
  <li>Test Coverage: Ensures a test coverage rate of ≥ 90%.</li>
  <li>Performance Monitoring: Monitored using an online performance tool.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Visualization Techniques</h3>
The application will feature two main charts.
<ul>
  <li>Scatterplot: Displays the number of events in each location.</li>
  <li>Pie Chart: Visualizes the popularity of different event genres.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
This project aims to deliver a high-quality, user-friendly event planning application by leveraging the advantages of serverless architecture and PWAs, combined with a rigorous TDD methodology.
